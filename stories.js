const leadStory={name:'lead',title:'VACCINE CAUSES ZOMBIE EVENT',story:"&nbsp&nbsp&nbspChaos has broken out across the nation as the vaccine that was meant to stop the pandemic seems to have initiated a zombie event.  “Three days after the vaccine, she was devoid of everything that made her... her”, Florida resident Stacie Charlegmaine told us Friday. Charlegmaine’s sister, Beverley, had recently been admitted to Baptismal Florida Hospital with symptoms of what is being called as “the change” struck suddenly. Symptoms include the loss of all rational thought, increase of rage and violence, and a desire for human brains. We are learning that lesser symptoms also include flu-like congestion, sneezing, and headaches.  At this time, we do not know if it is contagious. Scenes like these are breaking out across the nation. In Washington D.C., infected citizens were found scaling the walls at the Capitol building and inciting violence against the capitol police. The entire city of Seattle in Washington has been overrun with bands of zombies and residents have been urged to stay in their homes as the streets are no longer safe. In what seems to be affecting about 40% of all that have received the vaccine, the change appears to occur anywhere between 3 and 20 days after receiving the second dose. As over five million vaccine doses have already been administered, the number of “zombies” is expected to reach at least two million by month's end. The Center for Disease Control has put an emergency halt on any further vaccine administration. It is currently unknown what is causing the zombie reaction to the vaccine or how to predict its occurrence.",length:650}

const story2={name:'story2',title:'THE SCARIEST PLACE ON EARTH',story:"&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAmid the growing numbers of infected zombie-like humanoids roam the nation, California’s Disneyland resort has announced that they will be closing their doors for good. The resort has remained closed since March of 2020, when they “temporarily” suspended business for the COVID-19 pandemic.  The west coast parks never re-opened and fell into socially distanced disrepair. “It’s a shame,” stated Tadashi Hamada, a California resident and longtime annual passholder. “The Disney parks have always been the happiest, safest, most feel-good escape from the real world.” Florida’s Walt Disney World resort has announced they will be temporarily shutting down as of January 17th. Plans to reopen will be announced once more information on the zombie infection is known.",length:650}

const story3={name:'story3',title:'INSTAFACE SUSPENDS PRESIDENT',story:"<strong>Mr. Stark, I’m not feeling so good…..<br><br>“I hate them.  I hate them all.  They are dead to me, every single one of them.  And not just the men, but the women and children too….”<br><br>“Brains. Brains.  I have to find myself some brains”<br></strong>These are just a few samples of posts by POTUS earlier this month on the popular Instaface social media platform.  Concern for the leader’s wellbeing has rippled across the nation and left citizens wondering if he has started making “the change”.  It has been confirmed that POTUS was one of the first to receive the vaccine, and his second dose was administered on January 9, 2021. “I’m not taking any chances, “ InstaFace’s CEO Marion Tuckerberg stated on Tuesday.  “I am not saying he is infected - that is something we do not know at this time -  but these posts are definitely causing uproar and chaos within an already divided nation.  It is time to shut him down.” Tuckerberg made recent news after a very controversial decision legally forcing all users of the platform to disclose their vaccine status as well as an indicator of zombie / not zombie.  Any registered account on InstaFace that does not disclose this information will be charged a penalty of $25,000 or more.  It is rumored that the platform has received government approval to verify statuses against the DOH and CDC data records.",length:275}
